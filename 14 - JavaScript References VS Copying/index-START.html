    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    let team = players
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    team[3] = "Brad"
    // now here is the problem!
    console.log(players);
    console.log(team);
    // editing the team array also changes the players array because the team array is just referncing the players array and they are the same saved data
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    
    // one way
    let team2 = players.slice();
    
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    let team3 = [].concat(players)
    
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    let team4 = [...players];

    let team5 = Array.from(players)

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80,
      social: {
        twitter: "@wesbos",
        facebook: "wesbos.developer"
      }
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const cap = person;
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99})
    const cap3 = {...person, number: 98, age: 12}
    // adjusting the deeper object also changes the original. need a function to clone deep to be able to change without touching the original
    cap3.social.twitter = "@coolman"
    console.log(person, cap2, cap3);

    //the cheap way to go around deep cloning :
    const cap4 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person));
    cap4.social.twitter = "@bro"
    console.log(person, cap4);


    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
